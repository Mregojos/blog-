# Hi, there ðŸ˜„

## About me 
âœ¨ Hi, there. My name is Matt and I am an engineer. I graduated with a degree in Electronics Engineering and now I am fully focused on Technology. I love learning different things and want to learn more about the world and the universe and beyond. My MBTI is INTP.

âœ¨ I am currently working on my portfolio, organizing and migrating them to GitHub.

âœ¨ My interests and focus areas are learning and building modern data stacks, cloud infrastructure, data processing, CI/CD pipelines, machine learning systems, and security protection.

âœ¨ Fun fact: I love Canada, technology, and learning.

âœ¨ My happy places: Being with my family, learning everything, watching my favorite shows like FRIENDS, One Piece, Detective Conan, and watching walking and driving tour around Canada and the world.  

My Interests > **Data | AI/ML | Cloud | DevOps | SRE | Cybersecurity**
